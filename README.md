# HELLO-WORLD
just for practicing how to use GitHub
-
now I know how to use these functions :
1) Create an repository 
  - repository is usually used to organize a single project.
  - can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything my project needs. 
  - add a README : a quick insight into my project
2) Start a new branch
  - when I want to make some changes to my repository and create a new version, which can be merged into the "main" branch later.
  - can create a new branch directly during editing changes(if there is no need for administration).
3) Committed changes to my repository
  - can write a commit message that describes my changes.
4) Open a Pull Request
  - is like requesting an agreement from the supervisor for merging a new branch into the main branch.
  - can look over changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they’re what we want to submit.
  - anyone can leave a messenger.
5) Confirm merge and Delete branch
  - when merge is confirmed, there is no need to save the new branch.
